This repository contains the source for the **wrapz** marketing site that is
published via GitHub Pages.

## Deploying changes

1. Commit your changes to the `main` branch (or open a pull request that merges
   into `main`).
2. Push the branch to GitHub. GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and deploys
   the site â€” no additional deployment steps are required.
3. Wait for the Pages build to finish (usually under a minute). You can monitor
   the status from the repository's **Actions** tab or the **Pages** settings
   page.
4. Visit [https://wrapz.site](https://wrapz.site) to verify the live site once
   the build completes. If you recently changed DNS or TLS settings, allow a few
   minutes for caches to update.

Because the custom domain is configured in the `CNAME` file, every successful
build is automatically served over HTTPS without further action.
